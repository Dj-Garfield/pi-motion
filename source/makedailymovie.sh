# makedailymovie.sh - written by Claude Pageau.
# Skip most recent file logic based on script by zengargoyle
# This script will create a daily movie from jpg files in motion folder
# It will then use mencoder to create avi movie and move it to a mount point
# make sure you create the required mnt folders and create the fstab entry to mount
# the remote share onto /home/pi/pi-timolo/mnt.  This folder MUST be empty before the share will mount.
# Verify the share point is mounted before running this script.
# Note the previous daily movie will be deleted when this script is run so you have 24 hours to
# fix any copy problem to external share mount point folder.
#
# Mounting a network share to /home/pi/pi-timolo/mnt folder
# it still might be updating.  This avoids a pi-timolo.py crash
# Note change the IP and sharename path below to suit your network
# You can mount the network share by adding
# the appropriate entry to the /etc/fstab
# example
#
# sudo nano /etc/fstab
#
# Add a similar line below to the fstab.
# This example mounts an external Hard Drive share
# on a RPI running openelec xbmc.
# Change the IP address, share name and paths appropriately (exclude the #)
#
# //192.168.1.154/sharename/Media/Images /home/pi/pi-timolo/mnt cifs username=root,password=openelec,uid=pi,gid=pi, 0 0
#
# Add a crontab entry to the root crontab per the below.
# make sure makedailymovie.sh is executable eg sudo chmod +x makedailymovie.sh
#
# sudo crontab -e
#
# Add similar crontab entry as line below (excluding the #).
# This would execute makedailymovie.sh at 10pm every day
