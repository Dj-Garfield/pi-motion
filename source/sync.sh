# version 1.3
# sync.sh written by Claude Pageau.  Requires /usr/local/bin/gdrive executable compiled from github source for arm
# Note gdrive is included with pi-timolo on github at https://github.com/pageauc/pi-timolo
# for gdrive details see https://github.com/odeke-em/drive 
# To manually install gdrive binary perform the following.
# cd /tmp
# wget https://github.com/odeke-em/drive/releases/download/v0.2.2-arm-binary/drive-arm-binary
# chmod +x drive-arm-binary
# sudo cp drive-arm-binary /usr/local/bin/gdrive
# cd ~
# gdrive version
# Follow instructions for initializing gdrive for pimotion
# gdrive init   
#
# This script will perform the following
# Runs gdrive only if it is not already running
# Looks for pimotion.sync file created by pimotion.py indicating there are new files to sync
# Kills gdrive process if it has been running too long. default is > 600 seconds or 10 minutes
# Suggest you run this script from a crontab every 5 minutes or so.  
# Add appropriate line to crontab using command sudo crontab -e
# example crontab entry below without # comment char
